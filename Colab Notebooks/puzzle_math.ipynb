The bags\n","con-tained large silver coins representing taxes collected by his emissaries in the twelve\n","provinces he ruled. The name of the emissary of the particular province was clearly\n","written on each bag. Each coin weighed a full pound, and since all the bags were almost\n","full, there was a lot of silver.\n","Suddenly a man dressed in rags was brought in by the guards and fell on his knees\n","before the sultan.\n","\n","“Majesty,” exclaimed the man, raising his hand, “I have a very important thing to-tell\n","you.”\n","“Speak, then,” said Ibn-al-Kuz.\n","“I am in the employ of one of your emissaries and I want to report his great treason\n","and crime toward you. All the coins in the bag he sent to you are underweight by one\n","ounce. In fact, I was one of the workers who rubbed the coins with rough cloth, taking\n","one ounce of silver from each of them. Since my master wronged me, I have decided to\n","let you know the truth.”\n","“Who is your master?” asked Ibn-al-Kuz, frowning, “I swear to Allah that he will be\n","decapitated tomorrow, and you will get a rich reward!”\n","“He is . . .” began the man.\n","At this moment a dagger thrown by an unknown hand whistled through the air, and the\n","man fell dead with the dagger sticking out of his back.\n","\n","It might seem an easy matter to find which of the twelve bags contained the\n","underweight coins, provided that the sultan owned reasonably precise scales, which could\n","distinguish between regular 16-ounce coins and the molested coins which weighed only\n","15 ounces. In fact, the sultan did have such scales, and very fancy ones at that. He had\n","had them custom-made by a fine instrument manufacturer in the United States of\n","America, and they were modeled upon the regular weighing machines which one finds\n","practically everywhere in this highly industrialized country. There was a platform to step\n","on and a slot in which to drop a penny and instead of showing the weight on a dial the\n","machine printed a ticket giving the exact weight in pounds and ounces complete with\n","fortune on the back. \n","\n","The trouble was, however, that among all the coins in his possession\n","Sultan Ibn-al-Kuz had only one American copper penny. He could put any assortment of\n","silver coins from all the bags on the platform, but he could get only a single answer on\n","the printed ticket for the total weight of that assortment.\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VTyyfuoxpify","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uxM6YV4as7OC","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
